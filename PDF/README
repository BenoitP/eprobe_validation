=================

For each test machine, this directory contains the following pdf files:

1) His_CPU-MB_FREQ_"%02d".pdf: files that report the histogram of power 
   increase difference between the DPM and RAPL when the power at the 
   minimal CPU frequency is compared to power at the maximal CPU frequency 
   at a fixed number of cores.

2) His_CPU-MB_PROC_"%02d".pdf: files that report the histogram of power 
   increase difference between the DPM and RAPL when the benchmarks are
   run for each pair of an increasing number of cores at a fixed CPU 
   frequency.

Data related to the temperature and the idleness are contained in the
POWTEMP and idleOFF sub-directories.
