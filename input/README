For each test machine, this directory contains the following sub-directories:

microBGen/ Power measurements data when the CPU frequency and the 
           number of cores are varied.

POWTEMP/   Power measurements data for the temperature parameter 
           obtained for the minimal and the maximal CPU frequency 
           and running with 1 core.

idleOFF/   Power measurements data when the CPU is running at the
           different c-states available on the machine (only on SB).
