Microbenchmarks
---------------

The folder contains the source of all the microbenchmarks used. Each
microbenchmark can be run using the "microlauncher" tool, found at
https://code.google.com/p/microperf/.

Benchmark generation
--------------------

The benchmarks are generated from a set of most representative instructions in the /bin directory. In order to determine those instructions, run the scipt "most_rep_instrs.sh" in the "generator" folder.

Assembly  programs are generated by "microcreator" (also found at https://code.google.com/p/microperf/) through the script "microBGen.py".
The tools "microcreator" and "microdetect" must be accessible in the PATH environment variable when running the latter python script.

In brief, the chain of operations performed to get the benchmarks is the following:
* Representative instructions parsed using the shell script. Related XML description manually written in the "rep_ipatterns/" directory.
* The python script runs "microcreator" using random combinations of instructions to generate various assembly files.
* "microlaunch" run the assembly files and perform the time and energy measurements.

The instruction descriptions used to generate the assembly files used in the paper are distributed in the "rep_ipatterns" directory.
